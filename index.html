        <p id="rules">The aim of this game is to match pairs of the cards in different languages Belarusian-English.<br>
            There are eight pairs to match. These consist of eight popular pet names in English and their Belarusian
            equivalent.<br>
            Click on a card to turn it over. Then click on another one.<br>
            If the two cards match, they will stay face-up. If the two cards do not match, they will return
            face-down.<br>
            The game ends when all the cards have been matched in pairs.<br>
            Game is over if time is up.<br>
            There is a Play Again button that mixed up all cards for a fresh start.<br>
            Press Play button to start a game. There is two minutes to complete the game. Time starts when Play button
            is clicked.<br>
            Good luck! Enjoy!
